# odoo-allocation-app

Main purpose is for allowing for proper inventory and order allocation for apparel-based companies.

This repository now contains the ``apparel_allocation`` Odoo add-on. The module adds configurable
allocation rules that keep sale orders in a "Needs Allocation" state until size targets are met.
Administrators can decide whether to evaluate variant-level quantities or only template totals for
companies that do not use product variants.
