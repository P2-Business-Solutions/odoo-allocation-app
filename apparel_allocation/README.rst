Apparel Allocation Rules
========================

This module provides size-aware allocation rules for apparel wholesalers so that
sale orders only progress when balanced assortments are planned. Administrators
can toggle whether rules evaluate product variants or template totals, add
size-specific targets per product template, and stop confirmations until
requirements are satisfied.
